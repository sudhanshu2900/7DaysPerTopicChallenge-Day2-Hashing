PROBLEM: Given two arrays a and b. Given q queries each having a positive integer i denoting an index of the array a. For each query, 
         your task is to find all the elements less than or equal to qi in the array b.

Input:
      N=6
      a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
      b[] = {0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4} 
      Query 1 -> 5
      Query 2 -> 4
Output : 6
         6
         
Explanation: For 1st query, the given index is 5, A[5] is 9 and in B all the elements are smaller than 9.
             For 2nd query, the given index is 4, A[4] is 7 and in B all the elements are smaller than 7.  
             
             
             
SOLUTION:


vector<long long> find(vector<long long> a,vector<long long> b,vector<long long> q) {
    vector<long long> resCnt;
    int cnt=0;
    for(int i=0;i<q.size();i++){
        int ele = a[q[i]];
        for(int j=0;j<b.size();j++){
            if(b[j]<=ele)
                cnt++;
        }
        resCnt.push_back(cnt);
        cnt=0;
    }
    return resCnt;
}
